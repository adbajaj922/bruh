Mechatronics Calculator App

This app is designed for junior-level mechatronics students preparing for exams.

Modules:
- Sample and Aliasing: Calculates Nyquist rate, checks for aliasing, and calculates aliased frequencies.
- Waveforms: Plots sine, cosine, square, and triangle waves with adjustable parameters.
- Frequency Domain: Provides conceptual understanding of frequency components.
- Fourier Transforms: Includes a simplified Discrete Fourier Transform example.
- Introduction to Sensing: Defines sensor types and calculates sensitivity.
- 1st Order Sensors: Calculates time constants and simulates step responses.

Instructions:
- Use the main menu to navigate between modules.
- Input numerical values as prompted.
- View plots and results in message boxes.
- For plotting wave forms, the X axis is time, and the Y axis is the amplitude of the signal.
- The Simplified DFT is only for example purposes, and is not a full implementation.

Notes:
- This app is intended for educational purposes.
- Full FFT implementation is limited due to HP Prime processing constraints.
- Error handling is included for basic input validation.
- The GUID in the .hpapp file must be unique.
